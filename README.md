# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	This project was drawn from a large set of data covering crowdfunding endeavors through various forms of media such as radio, television, and theater productions such as musicals and plays.
 	From this data we are able to ask and then answer certain questions related to recorded variables.

### Purpose
	The purpose of this project is to answer two primary questions;
		a) Did launch dates and funding goals of theaters affect outcomes in terms of being successful, failed or canceled.
		b) Did funding goal amounts of plays affect outcomes in terms of the percentage that were successful, failed or canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
	The challenges in this analysis relate to properly filtering and formatting the data to yield useful answers to our questions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Analysis of this data provided some usefull insights.  We can clearly see that launch dates occurring in the springtime to early summer, 
	approximately from Aril to July, were much more likely to enjoy success; however, we can also see that in terms of failed campaigns, launch date had 
	very little affect. While the data proposes that the best time to launch a campaign is between April and July, clearly there are other factors that 
	that determine success or failure given that failed campaigns show no change related to this time frame. 
	
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
