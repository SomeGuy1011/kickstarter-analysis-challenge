# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	This project was drawn from a large set of data covering crowdfunding endeavors through various forms of media such as radio, television, and theater productions such as musicals and plays.
 	From this data we are able to ask and then answer certain questions related to recorded variables.

### Purpose
	The purpose of this project is to answer two primary questions;
		a) Did launch dates and funding goals of theaters affect outcomes in terms of being successful, failed or canceled.
		b) Did funding goal amounts of plays affect outcomes in terms of the percentage that were successful, failed or canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
	The challenges in this analysis relate to properly filtering and formatting the data to yield useful answers to our questions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Analysis of Theater outcomes based on launch dates provided some useful insights.  We can clearly see from the chart below that launch dates occurring in the springtime to early summer, 
	approximately from Aril to July, were much more likely to enjoy success; however, we can also see that in terms of failed campaigns launch date had 
	very little affect. While the data proposes that the best time to launch a campaign is between April and July, clearly there are other factors that 
	that determine success or failure given that failed campaigns show no change related to this time frame. It would be more precise to say that successful campaigns
	can benefit additionally by opening between April and July.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Analysis of Plays based on funding goals supports the idea that smaller goals lead to more outcomes of success.  This aligns with what we might expect given that smaller goals
	tend to be more manageable and, therefore, achievable.  This trend can be seen in the chart below with the exception of the 35000 to 45000 range which are likely outliers.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Discovering the correct formula to pull successful outcomes over proved difficult.  The rest fell into place after that.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Launch Date has little or no affect on creating failed outcomes.
	Launch Date can have a positive effect on successful campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Smaller, more achievable goals may support more successful outcomes.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	We filtered data to the US but that covers a large territory with many regional, cultural and socioeconomic differences unaccounted for.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	I experimented with several charts and feel that the bar charts might represent this data even more clearly.
